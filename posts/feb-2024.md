## Wiki Updates

* Our official pastebin, **[snowbin](https://pastes.fmhy.net/)** is now live! Keep in mind pastes only last for 7 days, and as of now you can't make edits, but we may add features like this in the future.

* Ran a [poll](https://i.imgur.com/73paJlr.png) regarding streaming sites, and used the results to help us re-order the [streaming section.](https://fmhy.net/videopiracyguide)

* Turned Spotify into its own section w/ subsections: [Clients](https://fmhy.net/audiopiracyguide#spotify-clients), [Adblockers](https://fmhy.net/audiopiracyguide#spotify-adblockers), [Download](https://fmhy.net/audiopiracyguide#spotify-download) and [Tools](https://fmhy.net/audiopiracyguide#spotify-tools).

* Added a section for [Soundtracks](https://fmhy.net/audiopiracyguide#media-soundtracks) in Audio. 

* Added sections for [Computer Science](https://fmhy.net/devtools#computer-science) and [Docker](https://fmhy.net/devtools#docker-tools) in Dev Tools.

* Added a section for [Two-Factor Authentication](https://fmhy.net/adblockvpnguide#two-factor-authentication) in Web Privacy.

* Re-organized [Magazine Sites](https://fmhy.net/readingpiracyguide#magazines) + added filehosts to their descriptions.

* Removed OnStream from unsafe sites. The ["evidence"](https://rentry.co/upo2r) we had listed wasn't very solid. If someone has more proof we can re-consider, but for now we don't have reason enough to call them unsafe. Keep in mind its not posted in the wiki, just removed from our unsafe list.

* We recently moved off Netlify, and soon after a scammer [took over the domain](https://i.imgur.com/rByoHnf.png). If you had this page bookmarked we'd highly recommend you remove it, and update to our [new domain](https://fmhy.net/). We've tried reporting it to Netlify, but so far they haven't done anything.

* Grammar issues have been fixed [throughout the wiki](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pull/1337) / [2](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pull/1340) / [3](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pull/1339). Remember that anyone can send [pull requests](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit) to our github so don't be afraid to help us fix things like this.

* Added a mirror of our site to [github.io](https://fmhy.github.io/FMHYedit/).
