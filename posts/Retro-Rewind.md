# What is Retro Rewind?

[Retro Rewind](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Retro_Rewind) is a Mario Kart Wii custom track distribution that features ***every retro track*** from Super Mario Kart to Mario Kart 7, as well as some from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart Tour, totaling 144. Retro Rewind can be played online in public rooms with Dolphin Emulator, a Wii or WiiU.

It also features many [enhancements](https://ibb.co/RCckmdT) such as:

* Max VR has been is increased from 9999 to 30000.
* Thunderclouds are now [Mega Clouds](https://i.imgur.com/8H54rGH.mp4), which give Mega Mushrooms, rather than shrinking.
* Added (optional) inside drift to all vehicles, meaning more of them are competitive. 
* Outside drift bikes have an extra level of mini turbo, and karts have three levels, similar to MK8DX.
* Vehicles can brake while drifting, making all tracks playable, and more vehicles viable.
* Ability to change or randomize vehicle/character combo between races.
* Significantly faster menu animations and load times between races.
* Unpopular modes like 100cc and mirror have been removed from online.

# Things to Note

* You need to turn on things like inside drift, fast menus, and finishing times in the Retro Rewind settings.

* Retro Rewind uses WiiLink, and does NOT require a NAND to play online with Dolphin.

* If you don't know anything about Mario Kart Wii, or why it has a cult following 16 years after its release, I'd suggest checking out [TWD98](https://www.youtube.com/@TWD98). Troy plays a lot, so its a good way to learn about the game and improve.
